Q1 The two types of boolean in python are True and False.
Q2: and, Or,  not
Q3: and truth table
		False 	False     =    False
		True 	False   =	     False
		False     True    =      False
		True     True    =      True
       or truth table 
		False    False    =   False
		True    False   =    True
		False   True     = True
		True   	True   =   True
   not truth table
		True  =   False
     		False = True
Q4:   (a)  False
          (b)False
          (c)True
          (d)False
          (e)True
Q5: (i) Arithmetic operator
       (ii)comparison operator
       (iii)logical operator
       (iV)Bitwise operator
      (v)identity operator
      (vi)membership operator
Q6: equal to sign is denoted as == while as assignment operator is denoted as =
when we assign a variable any value we do it by assignment operator eg; a = 10, b = 10
if we have to compare if the two variables are equal we use equal to sign as 
if a == b:
	print("variables are equal")
else:
	print("variables are not equal")
Q7: There is indentation error in this code.
Q8: spam = int(input("Enter 1 for hello 2 for howdy else enter any number for greetings: "))

if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("welcome to python")
Q9: ctrl+c
Q10: break statement is used  to exit from the loop and used in switch statements eg
 	for i in range(10):
    if(i == 4):
        break
    print(i)
           continue statement is used to skip on iteration which is given and continue with next iterations eg;
       for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        continue;
    print(i)
Q11:range(0,10 ) Here, start=0 and stop = 10. stop : (Upper limit) generate numbers up to this number, i.e., An integer number specifying at which position to stop (upper limit). The range() never includes the stop number in its result. step : Specify the increment value.
Q12: for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
Q13:  spam.bacon
